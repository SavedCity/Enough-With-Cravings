# Recipe-website

Website name: Enough with hunger

Technologies I used: HTML, CSS, jQuery, API
UI modules: Sticky nav and modal

On my website I took the approach of making it very user friendly, have a lot of features that the user may like, easily readable content, and having the user get something out of the website (in this case, recipes).

My inspiration of building this website is my love for food. All kinds of food. Everyone loves food though...
